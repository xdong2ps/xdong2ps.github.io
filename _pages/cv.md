  * Advertisement Campaign Platform
* Software Engineer, Bloomberg, New York, NY (Dec 2020 - Sep 2022)
  * Refactored the most heavily used ticketing screen shared across multiple teams; broke down the monolith
repository (20k lines of code) consisting of several team's business logic into submodules; reduced bug-related tickets by 30%, while getting a more extendable, testable codebase that significantly increased productivity.
  * Acted as the engineering lead of a redesign of an overnight carry-over rate calculation API for Repo (repurchase agreement) ticket; engaged with clients to clarify the functionality of the API; dissected the project into deliverable stories and prioritized based on Agile development method; followed through the lifecycle of the project development after launching to production.
  * Led the revamping of financial figures calculation of Repo ticket by leveraging an internal third-party API; hosted several design meetings within the team and documented project progress; engaged with API owner for question clarifications; prototyped a design to prove the feasibility.
  * Observed and resolved the slowness issue during manual ticket booking by adding RabbitMQ to the ticketing service to honor manual ticket booking over ticket booking in the background; greatly improved the manual ticket booking speed.

* Software Engineer, Bloomberg, New York, NY (Jul 2020 - Dec 2022)
  * Built a new internal machine learning framework handling the entire development pipeline from data serialization to model deployment, facilitating more independent model development and precise business responsibility dissection.
  * Completed document classification and entity extraction projects from financial documents, using tools such as GiGwork and Snorkel for data collection and augmentation, PyTorch and sklearn for model development, and Kubernetes for automatic model deployment.
* Software Engineer Intern, Bloomberg, New York, NY (May 2019 - Aug 2019)
  * Enabled memory-sharing among ticker message queues with atomic lock-free queue; allowed less active tickers to be grouped together and freed up memory resources to accommodate more clients, leading to 10X boost in resource utilization efficiency.
