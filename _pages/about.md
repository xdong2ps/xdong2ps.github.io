I am a Software Engineer at [Google](https://www.google.com/) based in Mountain View, CA. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/careers/working-here/engineering/) for two years. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). During my time at Notre Dame, I have authored and co-authored four peer-reviewed papers in various highly competitive NLP and social sensing and computing venues such as [EMNLP](https://2021.emnlp.org/), [ACM/IEEE ASONAM](https://asonam.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/2019/), [ACM/IEEE IWQoS](https://iwqos2020.ieee-iwqos.org/), [IEEE SECON](https://secon2020.ieee-secon.org/). I have also previously interned at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/)'s Personal Robots group. I am currently working towards an [SCPD NDO](https://scpd.stanford.edu/) certificate on the AI track from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
