I am a Software Engineer at Google based in Mountain View, CA. Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Bloomberg for two years. Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Notre Dame. During my time at Notre Dame, I have authored and co-authored four peer-reviewed papers in various highly competitive NLP and social sensing and computing venues such as EMNLP, ACM/IEEE ASONAM, ACM/IEEE IWQoS, IEEE SECON. I am currently working towards an NDO certificate on the AI track from Stanford University.

Work/Leadership Experience (Bloomberg)
======
* Independently refactored a hard-to-maintain code base of a ticket booking screen heavily used across several teams; reduced the bug-related alarms by 30%; allowed for a faster and less error-prone development experience for future developers, two new modules onboarded to the screen smoothly after the refactoring.
* Acted as the engineering lead of a redesign of an overnight carry-over rate calculation API for Repo (repurchase agreement) ticket; engaged with clients to clarify the functionality of the API; dissected the project into deliverable stories and prioritized based on Agile development method; followed through the lifecycle of the project development after launching to production.
* Led the revamping of financial figures calculation of Repo ticket by leveraging an internal third-party API; hosted several design meetings within the team and documented project progress; engaged with API owner for question clarifications; prototyped a design to prove the feasibility.
* Observed and resolved the slowness issue during manual ticket booking by adding RabbitMQ to the ticketing service to honor manual ticket booking over ticket booking in the background; greatly improved the manual ticket booking speed.
* Mentored a new developer of the team during my second year at Bloomberg
